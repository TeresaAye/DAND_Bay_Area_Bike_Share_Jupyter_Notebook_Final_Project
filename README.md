This project has step by step instructions on how to wrangle data, create charts, etc.

This was one of the first projects for completion of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree (DAND).

The word document is the review by Udacity team.

I was a new python / jupyter notebook learner at this point.
I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analytics Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)
