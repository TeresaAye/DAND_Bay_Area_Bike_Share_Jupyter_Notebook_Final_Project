# Jupyter_Notebook_Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Final_Project

This is a project that I completed for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Introductory Module.
I used Jupyter Notebook to do an analysis of the Bay Area Bike Share Data.

Open the html
or open the zip folder and run the ipynb

This project has step by step instructions on how to wrangle data, create charts, etc.

This was one of the first projects for completion of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND).

The pdf document is the review by Udacity team.

I was a new python / jupyter notebook learner at this point.
I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analyst Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)
